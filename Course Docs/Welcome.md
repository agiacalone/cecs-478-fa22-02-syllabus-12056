Welcome to CECS 378!

I hope that you all have had a great and relaxing winter break and you are ready to dive in to Computer Security. In preparation for class this week, I have some things that I would like you to do before we hold our first class session. Please review all of these items as soon as you are able to:

First, please make sure that you are able to locate a copy of our textbook, Computer Security: Principles and Practice, 4th Edition by William Stallings and Lawrie Brown. I will mention this during our first lecture session when I review the syllabus. You won't need the book for the first week or so, per-se, but the sooner you are able to get the textbook, the sooner you can start working on the assignments. We will be using Github Classroom for our assignment submissions this semester and I will be getting out links for more info all in the week to come--including some tutorials on how to effectively use git/Github/Github Classroom.

If you would like to sign up in advance for Github Education (assuming that you do not already have an account) please see this site: https://education.github.com. I highly suggest (although, it isn't *absolutely* necessary) to get the Student Developer pack. It'll give you a bunch of neat tools for free.

We will be holding class sessions via Zoom during the normal class lecture times (beginning on Monday January 24). Please make sure that you have access to Zoom by creating an account using your student email address (with your student email address, you should automatically have access to Zoom's premium service). The Zoom meeting link for our lecture session is listed below at the bottom of this message.

Stay safe and healthy everyone, and see you on Zoom for our first lecture on Monday!
